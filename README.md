## ‚ùìWhat is this application for?

The purpose is to provide a Discord bot that will react (or not) on
specific words being posted on your channel(s).

## ‚úÖ Check order

Gilfoyle will check for the first action filling requirements
(**in that very order**):

1.  Is it a scapegoat request?
    > Ex: <u>`@Gilfoyle`</u> who's the <u>goat</u>?<br>
    Gilfoyle will announce a random name from `SCAPEGOAT_TARGETS`
    

2.  Is it a request to get random values?
    > Ex: <u>`@Gilfoyle`</u> give me <u>luck</u><br> 
    Gilfoyle will announce random *number*, *letter*, *true*/*false*, *yes*/*no*,
    *heads*/*tails*, *direction*, *chifumi*
    

3.  Is it a game request?
    > Gilfoyle will announce a game launch / a victory (the `GAME_TRIGGER` has
    been posted, Gilfoyle will help you with the `GAME_RESPONSE` for you to be
    the first posting the `GAME_WINNING_ANSWER`)
    

4.  Is it a score request?
    > Ex: <u>`@Gilfoyle`</u> what's the <u>score</u>?<br>
    Gilfoyle will announce the current score board according to the
    `SCAPEGOAT_TARGETS` list provided and to the game results
    

5.  Is a word matching any NLU intent?
    > Gilfoyle will announce a quote linked with the previous posted message

```
