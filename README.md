## ‚ùìWhat is this application for?

The purpose is to provide a Discord bot that will react (or not) when
specific words will be posted on your channel(s).

### ‚úÖ Check order

Gilfoyle will check for the first action filling requirements
(**in that very order**):

1.  Announce a random scapegoat according to the `SCAPEGOAT_TARGETS` list
    provided
    

2.  Announce random values (number, letter, true/false, yes/no,
    heads/tails, direction, chifoumi)
    

3.  Announce a game launch / a victory (the `GAME_TRIGGER` has been posted,
    Gilfoyle will help you with the `GAME_RESPONSE` for you to be the first
    posting the `GAME_WINNING_ANSWER`)
    

4.  Announce the current score board according to the `SCAPEGOAT_TARGETS` list
    provided and the game results
    

5.  Announce a film quote linked with the previous posted message
